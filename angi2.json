They were able to build a modern addition that fits in seamlessly with our 120-year-old home. Throughout the process, Home Solutions was always there to listen to our suggestions. The team members were exceptionally personable, courteous, and conscientious and listened to our ideas \u2013 they made changes on the fly based on our feedback. They were even able to match the new trim to the existing intricate trim and molding. The high quality of work and finishes speaks to their attention to detail.

While we decided what we wanted, he took extensive measurements of our kitchen to ensure that all of our new cabinets would fit exactly. He had suggestions as to how we could improve the layout and functionality of our kitchen. We received drawings to approve and were able to make changes to details like moving the location of the trash, the width of the spice pullout, and where the knife block would be located. Both Eli and Susan were tremendously helpful and didn't hesitate to make the changes that we requested. Mike, the installer, was careful, talented, and one of the nicest people we have ever worked with. He and his assistant did a superior job with the installation of the cabinets and the crown moulding. My husband is a retired union carpenter who knows wood and quality craftsmanship.

While we decided what we wanted, he took extensive measurements of our kitchen to ensure that all of our new cabinets would fit exactly. He had suggestions as to how we could improve the layout and functionality of our kitchen. We received drawings to approve and were able to make changes to details like moving the location of the trash, the width of the spice pullout, and where the knife block would be located. Both Eli and Susan were tremendously helpful and didn't hesitate to make the changes that we requested. Mike, the installer, was careful, talented, and one of the nicest people we have ever worked with. He and his assistant did a superior job with the installation of the cabinets and the crown moulding. My husband is a retired union carpenter who knows wood and quality craftsmanship.

This was our first significant remodel of any home we\u2019ve ever owned. At that time, many contractors were very busy and/or very expensive. We discussed our project with at least a dozen potential contractors. We chose MH Renovations, and we are thrilled with that decision. Project. We completely remodeled the existing kitchen and 2 full bathrooms. We replaced all flooring and repainted the entire inside. We replaced and added wood trim in various rooms. We replaced the boiler, added A/C, and replaced a large portion of the electrical system. Value. We felt the quality of workmanship was above average, and the cost was below average. Generally, we agree with the old axiom that you get what you pay for. So, we felt we got more than we paid for. For a couple who\u2019s generally quite frugal, that\u2019s saying a lot. Decisions. With any large project like this, there are a thousand decisions to be made. This contractor seemed to know exactly which decisions they should make and which to let the homeowner make. We were glad to be shielded from the smaller decisions and be asked on the bigger ones. Just right. Communications. Just perfect. Not too much, and we never felt in the dark on anything. Changes. With a large project, we expected we\u2019d want to make some changes during the project. That was true, and the contractor was perfectly happy to accommodate those requests and give us options. Perfect. Schedule. At a time when most contractors were giving start dates of 6-8 months out and more, this contractor quoted us just 3 months to begin. That was about the earliest of any quote. We were thrilled when they even were able to start a month earlier. And after they began, they pressed to keep the project on time, working with various sub-contractors, while shielding us from any of that pain. So our project started early (Feb 2022), completed with the expected duration, and ended early (April 2022). Far exceeded our expectations. Unexpected issues. As with any large project, there will always be some unforeseen issues. For ours, it was the existing electrical system. The subcontracted electrician uncovered ungrounded outlets, missing switch and outlet boxes, wiring comprised of foot-long parts, and bare wires. All you can hope for is that those problems get identified and rectified correctly, and that it doesn\u2019t cost an arm and a leg. Our contractor kept us informed and searched for related, hidden issues once problems became clear. Our contractor genuinely felt bad about this added cost, and very generously did some of the work without adding cost. This is going above and beyond for your customer. Our contractor handling these unexpected issue as well as we could have hoped for. Budget. If we hadn\u2019t added any requests during the project and didn\u2019t uncover the hidden/existing electrical issues, we would haven been right on budget. The unexpected electrical work added ~10% to the entire budget. That overrun was about what we expected when we budgeted for this project, so we felt we came out just fine on budget. Was it fun? Yes! We truly enjoyed our discussions/calls/texts/emails with our contractor. We genuinely liked our contractor, and that made the experience a lot less stressful and painful than it could have been otherwise. These are our people. And we liked their employees and their sub-contractors too. Everyone we encountered was just a pro. Would we hire this contractor again? Definitely. I\u2019m sure we will, and we won\u2019t bother calling anyone else.", "reportDate": "2022-04-10T12:50:48.265Z"}, {"reviewId": 38021971, "serviceProviderId": 5782601, "serviceProviderName": "Budget Right Handyman", "userName": "Beth P.", "starRating": 5, "leafSlug": "/companylist/us/il/chicago/budget-right-handyman-reviews-5782601.htm", "text": "Ryan C is very knowledgeable, on time and professional each time he worked for us.

Jim made sure I was pleased with the results before he left. I chose to dispose of the old doors and wood scrap through my trash service. The new doors work great! I like Jim.

This was our first significant remodel of any home we\u2019ve ever owned. At that time, many contractors were very busy and/or very expensive. We discussed our project with at least a dozen potential contractors. We chose MH Renovations, and we are thrilled with that decision. Project. We completely remodeled the existing kitchen and 2 full bathrooms. We replaced all flooring and repainted the entire inside. We replaced and added wood trim in various rooms. We replaced the boiler, added A/C, and replaced a large portion of the electrical system. Value. We felt the quality of workmanship was above average, and the cost was below average. Generally, we agree with the old axiom that you get what you pay for. So, we felt we got more than we paid for. For a couple who\u2019s generally quite frugal, that\u2019s saying a lot. Decisions. With any large project like this, there are a thousand decisions to be made. This contractor seemed to know exactly which decisions they should make and which to let the homeowner make. We were glad to be shielded from the smaller decisions and be asked on the bigger ones. Just right. Communications. Just perfect. Not too much, and we never felt in the dark on anything. Changes. With a large project, we expected we\u2019d want to make some changes during the project. That was true, and the contractor was perfectly happy to accommodate those requests and give us options. Perfect. Schedule. At a time when most contractors were giving start dates of 6-8 months out and more, this contractor quoted us just 3 months to begin. That was about the earliest of any quote. We were thrilled when they even were able to start a month earlier. And after they began, they pressed to keep the project on time, working with various sub-contractors, while shielding us from any of that pain. So our project started early (Feb 2022), completed with the expected duration, and ended early (April 2022). Far exceeded our expectations. Unexpected issues. As with any large project, there will always be some unforeseen issues. For ours, it was the existing electrical system. The subcontracted electrician uncovered ungrounded outlets, missing switch and outlet boxes, wiring comprised of foot-long parts, and bare wires. All you can hope for is that those problems get identified and rectified correctly, and that it doesn\u2019t cost an arm and a leg. Our contractor kept us informed and searched for related, hidden issues once problems became clear. Our contractor genuinely felt bad about this added cost, and very generously did some of the work without adding cost. This is going above and beyond for your customer. Our contractor handling these unexpected issue as well as we could have hoped for. Budget. If we hadn\u2019t added any requests during the project and didn\u2019t uncover the hidden/existing electrical issues, we would haven been right on budget. The unexpected electrical work added ~10% to the entire budget. That overrun was about what we expected when we budgeted for this project, so we felt we came out just fine on budget. Was it fun? Yes! We truly enjoyed our discussions/calls/texts/emails with our contractor. We genuinely liked our contractor, and that made the experience a lot less stressful and painful than it could have been otherwise. These are our people. And we liked their employees and their sub-contractors too. Everyone we encountered was just a pro. Would we hire this contractor again? Definitely. I\u2019m sure we will, and we won\u2019t bother calling anyone else.", "reportDate": "2022-04-10T12:50:48.265Z"}, {"reviewId": 38021971, "serviceProviderId": 5782601, "serviceProviderName": "Budget Right Handyman", "userName": "Beth P.", "starRating": 5, "leafSlug": "/companylist/us/il/chicago/budget-right-handyman-reviews-5782601.htm", "text": "Ryan C is very knowledgeable, on time and professional each time he worked for us.

He brought brochures of doors for me to choose from. Within three weeks, Jim returned with the doors to do the job. Jim removed the old doors, also the inside wood door trim without one making one crack in my old plaster walls, removed the rotten wood beneath the door, and baseboard where the tile was laid. I watched Jim as he worked, he is very meticulous. I did not realize the time and work involved in prepping for the installation of the doors. The doors went in, new wood on the inside to replace the old wood frame, the rotten big piece of wood under the door was replaced, tile laid, baseboard replaced, some insulation placed, I kept my old lock, and got a new door knob. Jim made sure I was pleased with the results before he left. I chose to dispose of the old doors and wood scrap through my trash service. The new doors work great! I like Jim.

At the initial estimate visit my wife forgot to include another bedroom where window damage occurred; this was later added to the job at the same pricing as the other window repairs. We met at a local do-it-yourself store to select tile and purchase a shower base and surround. Mr. Faust did not like any of the shower sets were there, but said he would pick up a set elsewhere for a similar price and would invoice me for that, along with the tile. We picked up a shower control, as well as a new ventilator for the bathroom. He suggested that we consider a different model, and the reasons he gave were valid, so we did, and saved money to boot. Mr. Faust kept us apprised of all that was going on, and when we stopped in to see how it was going, he was very good at showing us what was being worked on, as well as the problems he found. There was mold in the small master bath, and Mr. Faust spent a few days taking care of that problem. This threw off his schedule a bit, and he let us know that it would take a bit longer. We had no problems with that at all. When the final invoice showed up we were pleasantly surprised to see that the additional room did not increase the cost all that much, and that the cost of the shower and tile was well within the estimate he gave us at the home store. In fact, all tile that was not used was returned to the store for a credit, which he passed on to us. We are very pleased with the results, and would use this company again. Clinton Faust is professional and detail oriented. He found that the shower controls were not working properly, and was not going to declare the job complete until it was fixed. He actually included some value added features that were rolled into the cost such as a maintenance cutout that the original house did not have for the shower, along with shutoff valves for the shower unit.

Previously, they did a complete makeover of our kitchen and our big basement. My wife and I agree that when Joe and Tom are done doing what we've asked them to do, our lives have been made better and much more comfortable. Punctuality: Joe is ALWAYS on time, mostly early, and he's a neat freak. He cleans up at the end of each work day. Few men can wield a mop or vacuum the way Joe can. Communication: Five stars. A+. Joe's office manager, Lisa, couldn't be more prompt or accommodating. She also may be a finalist for Nicest Person in The World. Joe is blessed to have her dealing with clients. Quality: I can't tell you how many people who have seen Joe's work in our kitchen, basement, and now our foyer and power room, who are simply amazed at the extremely high level of construction and finish. I kid Joe about his obsession with doing things right. I told him that his gravestone will have etched upon it: \"He built it straight and plumb!\" I've tried to find even a small flub in Joe's work (I'm even more obsessive than he is) and I can't. That's saying something. Price: It's true -- you get what you pay for. Joe's work doesn't come cheap, but his prices are fair. He uses only the best materials and doesn't stop until the job is done right. You may be able to get a cheaper quote from someone else, but I'm here to tell you that you'll not be able to get better work than Joe will do for you. He has increased the value of our home immeasurably. Professionalism: You'll enjoy Joe's (and Tom's) demeanor. They both have a great sense of humor and can even put up with annoying jokesters like me. Joe's experience is so broad that he can make substantive comments about completing even the oddest type of job. It's a pleasure dealing with Joe, from estimate through final cleanup. I've got Joe scheduled for at least four more jobs: two more bathrooms, a deck renovation, and garage improvements. I don't view it as \"spending\" with Joe; it's much more like \"investing.\" The work he does will pay us back handsomely through the improved value his work adds to our home.

At the initial estimate visit my wife forgot to include another bedroom where window damage occurred; this was later added to the job at the same pricing as the other window repairs. We met at a local do-it-yourself store to select tile and purchase a shower base and surround. Mr. Faust did not like any of the shower sets were there, but said he would pick up a set elsewhere for a similar price and would invoice me for that, along with the tile. We picked up a shower control, as well as a new ventilator for the bathroom. He suggested that we consider a different model, and the reasons he gave were valid, so we did, and saved money to boot. Mr. Faust kept us apprised of all that was going on, and when we stopped in to see how it was going, he was very good at showing us what was being worked on, as well as the problems he found. There was mold in the small master bath, and Mr. Faust spent a few days taking care of that problem. This threw off his schedule a bit, and he let us know that it would take a bit longer. We had no problems with that at all. When the final invoice showed up we were pleasantly surprised to see that the additional room did not increase the cost all that much, and that the cost of the shower and tile was well within the estimate he gave us at the home store. In fact, all tile that was not used was returned to the store for a credit, which he passed on to us. We are very pleased with the results, and would use this company again. Clinton Faust is professional and detail oriented. He found that the shower controls were not working properly, and was not going to declare the job complete until it was fixed. He actually included some value added features that were rolled into the cost such as a maintenance cutout that the original house did not have for the shower, along with shutoff valves for the shower unit.

Previously, they did a complete makeover of our kitchen and our big basement. My wife and I agree that when Joe and Tom are done doing what we've asked them to do, our lives have been made better and much more comfortable. Punctuality: Joe is ALWAYS on time, mostly early, and he's a neat freak. He cleans up at the end of each work day. Few men can wield a mop or vacuum the way Joe can. Communication: Five stars. A+. Joe's office manager, Lisa, couldn't be more prompt or accommodating. She also may be a finalist for Nicest Person in The World. Joe is blessed to have her dealing with clients. Quality: I can't tell you how many people who have seen Joe's work in our kitchen, basement, and now our foyer and power room, who are simply amazed at the extremely high level of construction and finish. I kid Joe about his obsession with doing things right. I told him that his gravestone will have etched upon it: \"He built it straight and plumb!\" I've tried to find even a small flub in Joe's work (I'm even more obsessive than he is) and I can't. That's saying something. Price: It's true -- you get what you pay for. Joe's work doesn't come cheap, but his prices are fair. He uses only the best materials and doesn't stop until the job is done right. You may be able to get a cheaper quote from someone else, but I'm here to tell you that you'll not be able to get better work than Joe will do for you. He has increased the value of our home immeasurably. Professionalism: You'll enjoy Joe's (and Tom's) demeanor. They both have a great sense of humor and can even put up with annoying jokesters like me. Joe's experience is so broad that he can make substantive comments about completing even the oddest type of job. It's a pleasure dealing with Joe, from estimate through final cleanup. I've got Joe scheduled for at least four more jobs: two more bathrooms, a deck renovation, and garage improvements. I don't view it as \"spending\" with Joe; it's much more like \"investing.\" The work he does will pay us back handsomely through the improved value his work adds to our home.

I decided to get another opinion and was referred to Pyramid by a friend. I called them and they were able to come out quickly and do a diagnostic on the furnace. Mike indicated that my current thermostat was not connecting correctly with the furnace and suggested a replacement. He completed a diagnostic analysis and found that the gas was running high, so it was overexerting. But he did not find any carbon monoxide leakage. I asked many questions to try to understand why each technician had such differing opinions. Mike was very patient. The following week, he replaced a part (heat/air inducer?) in my 1994 furnace for about $450. He cleaned/vacuumed and took note of some items to keep an eye on. Mike was polite and very thorough. He went over everything he did in detail. 2 days later, someone from Pyramid called to make sure everything went ok, asked if I had any questions and mentioned that they are part of the Clean Energy Works program.

I decided to get another opinion and was referred to Pyramid by a friend. I called them and they were able to come out quickly and do a diagnostic on the furnace. Mike indicated that my current thermostat was not connecting correctly with the furnace and suggested a replacement. He completed a diagnostic analysis and found that the gas was running high, so it was overexerting. But he did not find any carbon monoxide leakage. I asked many questions to try to understand why each technician had such differing opinions. Mike was very patient. The following week, he replaced a part (heat/air inducer?) in my 1994 furnace for about $450. He cleaned/vacuumed and took note of some items to keep an eye on. Mike was polite and very thorough. He went over everything he did in detail. 2 days later, someone from Pyramid called to make sure everything went ok, asked if I had any questions and mentioned that they are part of the Clean Energy Works program.
